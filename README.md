# React Native Figma Renderer

## Overview

Welcome to the React Native Figma Renderer! This is a powerful mobile app development tool that allows you to seamlessly integrate your designs from Figma into your React Native projects. Whether you're a designer looking to showcase your work or a developer aiming for pixel-perfect implementation, this tool has got you covered.

## Features

- **Figma Integration:** Easily import your Figma designs into the React Native app.
- **Pixel-Perfect Rendering:** Ensure that your designs are faithfully represented on mobile devices.
- **Interactive Prototyping:** Test out interactive elements and animations directly within the app.
- **Real-time Sync:** Keep your app's design in sync with Figma effortlessly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine
- [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) set up
- Figma account with your design files

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-native-figma-renderer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-native-figma-renderer
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure Figma API credentials:

   - Obtain your Figma API key from the [Figma Developer Console](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#authentication).
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Figma API key:

     ```env
     FIGMA_API_KEY=your_figma_api_key_here
     ```

### Usage

1. Run the Metro server:

   ```bash
   npx react-native start
   ```

2. Run the app on a connected emulator or device:

   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android
   # or
   npx react-native run-ios
   ```

3. Open the app and provide the Figma file URL for rendering.

## Configuration

Update the `config.js` file to customize the behavior of the Figma Renderer:

- `figmaFileUrl`: The URL of your Figma file.
- `renderOptions`: Additional options for rendering (e.g., device type, background color).

```javascript
module.exports = {
  figmaFileUrl: "https://www.figma.com/file/your-figma-file-id/Your-Design",
  renderOptions: {
    deviceType: "iPhoneX",
    backgroundColor: "#ffffff",
  },
};
```
